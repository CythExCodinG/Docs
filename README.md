# 📄 Docs Board – My First React Project

This is my first React project — an interactive draggable documents board where you can view, download, or remove files.  
It uses **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion** for drag-and-drop animation, and **React Icons** for icons.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Document Cards** – Displays document description, size, and action buttons.
- 🎯 **Drag and Drop** – Cards can be freely dragged around the screen.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works on both desktop and mobile screens.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Colors & Tags** – Each card can have different colors and tags based on data.
- 📥 **Download/Upload Button** – Shows download or close icon depending on the file’s state.
